### Object Oriented Programming
---
##### Inheritance
```
parent class : Cat
child class : Retriever 

child class can inherit all data fields and methods of parent class, while defining its own fields or methods 

Advantages : 
  1) Reusability : Do not have to write already existing lines of code 
```

##### Polymorphism
```
Triangle shape = new Triangle() 
Shape shape = new Triangle()           class triangle is a part of class shape (polymorphism)
Shape shape = new Circle()             class circle is a part of class shape 
Triangle shape = new Shape()           a triangle is a shape, but a shape is not a triangle (invalid)

public void run(Shape shape) {}        classes shape, triangle, and circle and all be passed to the parameter

Advantages :
  1) Flexibility
